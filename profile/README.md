# Welcome to HammerFall Interactive organization page

A small team from Novosibirsk, Russia, that consists of 4 team members.

For you, it might look like there is nothing going on here, but be sure, there is something cooking behind the scenes!
It is not that big of a game because since when we started doing it, we had nothing about game development 🎮 in our skill pocket except for a art 🎨 and programming 💻.

We hope to release the game eventually and maybe even start making another game, but we will see when the time will come 🕒!

Feel free to communicate with us through [me](https://github.com/craftersmine), if you find something interesting.

With much love ❤️ - HammerFall Interactive!
